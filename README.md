# CompanySearch

# Tasks completed,

* search page which passes the search data to the companies service (the api calls are written but not tested due to issues retrieving data)
* Http interceptor implemented for applying api key (stored in environmental variables);
* Company information stored in a mock variable, (cors connection issue to be rectified);
* login modal implemented with routing guard on company details.
* User can click through data for company info and company officers,

# tasks i would like to finish,
 * Sort the Cors issue so that the data present is actually from the search result and API request, this works in postman but does not seem to work from localhost
 * add error messaging to route guard so users know that they need to log in to view results.
 * apply more styling to the page.
 * enhance validation for forms beyond basic
